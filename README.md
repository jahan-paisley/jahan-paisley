### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0174056fe6a10d54d1)
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning problem-solving, CS, OCaml, and Architecture!
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on a Formal Verification project
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: "my Github username" @gmail.com
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to learn programming or freelancing; I'd like to help others by sharing my experience and know-how ðŸ¤™
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to play with different programming languages and once in a while build a breakable toy or a serious project with them ðŸ˜‰

<!-- 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever ;-)
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help building a website(sth like TrustPilot) to list outstanding business services and products
